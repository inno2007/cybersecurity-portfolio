# ðŸ”“ John the Ripper: Password Cracking

## Definition
Open source password security audit and password recovery. 

## Objective
Crack weak Linux user passwords from collected passwd and shadow files.

## Activities
- Merged `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` using `unshadow`.
- Used John the Ripper with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.
- Successfully cracked weak passwords.

## Key Commands
```bash
unshadow passwd shadow > combined.txt
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt combined.txt

## Learned commands

- Change Directory to Your Files
cd Documents
Navigates to the Documents folder where your password files are saved.
Make sure your passwd.txt, shadow.txt, mypasswd, and password.lst are in this folder.

- View the Contents of the Password File
cat file-name
Displays the combined unshadow file.

- Format should look like this:
alice:$6$...:18077:0:99999:7:::
Useful to confirm itâ€™s in the right format before cracking.

- Start John the Ripper (Default Mode)
john
Just running john alone starts the tool but doesnâ€™t do anything.
Youâ€™ll usually want to follow it with a target file (like mypasswd).

- View Cracked Passwords
john --show mypasswd
Displays the usernames and passwords that John has successfully cracked.

- Example output:
alice:password123
Very useful to check your progress after cracking.

- Crack Passwords Using Default Settings
john mypasswd
Starts cracking using default mode and default wordlist (often very limited).
Good as a quick test, but not effective for strong passwords.

- Use a Custom Wordlist
john mypasswd --wordlist="Password.lst"
Tells John to use Password.lst (a small lab dictionary file).
This is dictionary mode.

- Make sure the wordlist is in your current directory or use full path:
--wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt


- Dictionary + Rules Mode (Stronger)
john --wordlist=password.lst --rules mypasswd
Adds rules to modify the dictionary (e.g., adding numbers, capital letters).

- Makes the attack stronger by trying variations like:
password â†’ Password, password1, Password123, etc.
